# Assets Directory

This directory contains app assets like icons and splash screens.

## Required Assets

For a production build, you'll need:

1. **icon.png** (1024x1024) - App icon
2. **splash.png** (1284x2778) - Splash screen
3. **adaptive-icon.png** (1024x1024) - Android adaptive icon
4. **favicon.png** (48x48) - Web favicon

## Generating Assets

You can use Expo's asset generation:

```bash
npx expo-asset
```

Or create them manually using design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.

## Placeholder Assets

For development, simple placeholder images are included.
Replace these with your actual branding before publishing.
